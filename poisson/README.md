A Poisson model of sparse X-ray data.
Realizations of this toy model, detection statistics, etc can be generated via

```
./poisson
```

Note that this will create several sets of mock data with the same injection scaled in amplitude from zero (no injection) to approximately 10% of the noise.
This helps determine how the impact of possible biases due to data-selection procedures scales with the signal-to-noise ratio of the injection.
