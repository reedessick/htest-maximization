A simple example of estimating the mean of a univariate (shifted) exponential distribution from repeated observations of iid data.
We show that selecting which data to include so that you maximize the detection statistic (Bayes Factor) for a non-zero shift can lead to biases.

This example can be run via
```
./univariate-exponential
```
